      <h2>Balkans: Slovenia & Croatia</h2>
      <p>Back in 2019 before covid, I researched traveling to the Balkans ; I had settled on Slovenia because of Lake Bled and from comments on online that is a safe place for a lady/woman doing a solo trip. After covid, I did travel mostly in Africa for work and did an F1 trip to Abu Dhabi. Having done that, venturing out to Europe seems like the next adventure. I am not good with crowds; but I did have fun in Abu Dhabi during the F1 concerts. Slovenia seems like a Europe funnel entry for me as I begin this journey. I opted for Croatia as they are neighbours; and two stamps won't hurt my passport. These are just my thoughts that I am giving life to until they materialize. Because if you can see it in your mind; you can definitely bring it to life.</p> <br></p>
        Ohh.... and my name is Mischa. <br> for the purpose of this work.<br> my government name is not all that fun and mysterious. <h3>...and behold, my itinerary..</h3> <p> I am more a foodie but there is no evidence when you see in person. I don't know how to fast, I cannot be bothered to fast. My metabolism will not even allow it. It is fast like a Ferrari pit stop.</p> <br> this trip will be about food, photography and grapes since I don't do wine or alcohol. Oh yes, I will visit the vineyards to eat grapes with a massive smile on my face. Life is for the living.
